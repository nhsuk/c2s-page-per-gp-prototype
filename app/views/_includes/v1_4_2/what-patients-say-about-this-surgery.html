  <h2>What patients say about this surgery</h2>

  <p>Every year, the GP Patient Survey gives patients a chance to say how they feel about their GP surgery.</p>

  <p>The survey is independent and asks people about their experiences of:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>booking an appointment</li>
    <li>waiting times</li>
    <li>staff at the surgery</li>
  </ul>

  You can <a href="https://gp-patient.co.uk/practices/M86015">see results for this surgery on the GP Patient Survey website.</a>
