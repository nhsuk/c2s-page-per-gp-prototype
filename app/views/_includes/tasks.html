  <h3>If you can't get an appointment</h3>
  <p>You don't always have to see a GP if you have a health problem. For example you can <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Pages/hub.aspx">search this site for advice on your symptoms or condition</a>. Or you might be able to get help from a pharmacy.</p>
